D3 V4.

Hit the pull data button to pull in the testData.json file. 

Drag a rectangle around an area of interest to zoom in.

If anyone is interested in a more general version (to take in custom data), or would like me to correct something, leave a comment on the gist.

Update Dec 29th 2017
  - Mashed things together to make it work with v4
    - Pulling data from json file
    - Dynamically updating axes, and other properties, in case the testData should change, or I add an upload data feature.
